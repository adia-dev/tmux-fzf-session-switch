# TMUX FZF Session Switch

## Purpose

If you're like me and you tend to have a lot of sessions to organize your
thoughts then this is the plugin for you. With this plugin you can search
through your sessions with fzf.

## Install

- Install this <https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm>
- Put `set -g @plugin 'thuanpham2311/tmux-fzf-session-switch' into your tmux config
- Use tpm install plugin. Default you can press `prefix + I` (`I` is `shirt + i` = I)
- Finally. `prefix + l`

## Customization from Thuan Pham (that me)

- Work with session name have `space` character. e.g. "Thuan Pham is handsome"
- Don't confirm `y` to create new session, I just lazy press 2 time `Enter` to create new session.

## Functionality

- `Prefix + l`: Open up fzf in a new tab. (e.g. prefix = ctrl + a. Hold ctrl -> press a -> press f -> done)
- If you type a name that doesn't exist, you will be prompted to create it.

**Two way,  You want customize key binding**
1. You can folk this project and edit this line `default_key_bindings_goto="l"` in `main.tmux`, you change `set -g @plugin '{{your github username}}/tmux-fzf-session-switch' in your tmux config
2. You can create pull request, "feature custom keybinding" is good too üòÅ cuz I'm noob and lazy to make this feature.

## Requirements

- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf
- rg (recommended but not required)
